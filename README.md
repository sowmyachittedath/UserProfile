# UserProfile


Python-flask based User REST API

1. Supports user retrieval, creation and update
2. User profile includes name, email address and telephone number
3. API follows REST standards and uses verbs like GET, PUT and POST
4. User REST API supports password based authentication
5. Uses a relational database (MySQL) for storage
6. Passwords are encrypted in the storage
7. REST API should be self-contained and can be run in a Docker
container


This also secure additional APIs based on user authentication and
authorisation. 

1. Develop decorator definitions for protecting API methods
2. Decorators should work for all REST verbs (GET, POST and PUT)
